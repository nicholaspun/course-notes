\subsection{Overview of the Course}
Combinatorial optimization leverages tools from: combinatorics, linear programming theory and algorithms to \textit{efficiently} solve optimization problems on discrete structures (e.g. graphs)

The course will covering the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spanning frees
    \item Max flow, Min cut
    \item Matroids and matroid optimization
    \item Matchings and related problems
    \item Approximation algorithms
\end{itemize}
